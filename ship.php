			<h3>USS Theseus NCC-2013<br> <span class="subtext">Oberth class border cutter</span></h3>
			In service as early as the 2280s, the Oberth-class was designed and used almost exclusively for the study of astronomical phenomena, including data gathering missions on stars and planets, well into the 2360s.<br/>
			<br/>
			The Federation continued to construct Oberth-class starships as late as 2363, at such locations as the USSR's Baikonur Cosmodrome.<br/>
			<br/>
			The Oberth was present in several major Federation engagements including the Borg invasion of 2366-2367, where it participated at the Battle of Wolf 359, as well as the Battle of Sector 001 in 2373.<br/>
			<br/>
			The class would slowly be phased out of service during the 2370s, shortly after the introduction of the more advanced Nova-class science vessel.<br/>
