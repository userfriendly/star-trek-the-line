			In the year 2377 the Federation is counting the cost of the Dominion war while struggling to rebuild its decimated fleet. In the meantime, it needs a way to ensure no-one takes advantage of the calm after the storm, a way to make it known that Starfleet is still watching.<br/>
			<br/>
			Enter Starfleet’s Border Patrol, a mismatched fleet of ships well past their prime staffed with misfits, outcasts and rejects. And they are all that stands between the Federation and those that would seek to pick the wounds the war left behind. They are the final frontier, they are ... The Line.
